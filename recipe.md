INSTRUCTIONS
Making chenna for rasgulla
▢
Bring milk to a boil in a pot.
▢
If using non-homogenized milk (milk from milkman), then keep the pot aside. Wait for 5 mins.
▢
If using homogenized milk from packets or cartons then reduce the flame to low.
▢
Add 2 tbsp lemon juice & stir until the milk curdles. 
▢
If it doesn't curdle, add more & stir. 
▢
When you see the milk curdled completely, Switch off the stove. Rest for 2 mins. 
▢
Then pour cold water to the pot. This will stop the chena from cooking further & keeps it soft.
▢
Place a colander over a large bowl & line with a thin cloth. Drain the curdled milk.
▢
Rinse the chenna under running water to remove the acidic flavor. 
▢
Tie the cloth. Squeeze it well to remove the excess whey as much as possible.
▢
Hang it for 1 to 1½ hours. Chenna should not have any excess whey. It must be crumbly.
Making sugar syrup
▢
Add sugar, cardamoms & water to a wide pan or pot. 
▢
Make sure you use a wide pot good enough to hold all the rasgullas. 
▢
The balls will cook & almost double in size only if there is enough space in the pot.  
▢
Stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring it to a boil.
How to make rasgulla
▢
Knead the chenna well to make it a smooth dough for 3 to 5 mins. I do it just for 3 mins.
▢
Do not over knead to the extent that the chenna turns greasy or soggy. 
▢
When you see the mixture turns uniformly smooth and no more grainy, then stop kneading.
▢
Take small portions of this and roll to tiny balls.
▢
They should be tiny and not big as they expand in size after boiling. I made about 16.
▢
Add rose water to the sugar syrup. (optional).
▢
Bring the sugar syrup to a rolling boil on a medium flame.
▢
Remove the cardamom pods. Then add the balls one after the other gently.
▢
Cover the pot immediately with a lid. 
▢
The syrup must be boiling steadily at a constant heat.
▢
Cook on a medium flame for 9 to 10 mins . The syrup must be bubbling & boiling steadily through out this time.  So adjust the heat as needed depending on the kind of pot & stove used. 
▢
After 5 mins gently stir the sugar syrup once with a skewer without touching the rasgullas. Cover immediately. 
▢
This ensures even cooking and puffing. During the cooking time if you feel the heat is too much reduce the heat slightly, but ensure it is still bubbling & boiling.
▢
After 10 mins, remove the pot immediately from the stove to prevent rasgulla  from cooking further. 
▢
Keep the lid closed always otherwise they will shrink or fall flat. Do not open at least for 20 mins.
▢
They double in size and also sink in syrup when cooked completely.  
▢
Allow rasgulla to rest and cool completely. Serve them chilled. If desired garnish with saffron.
Optional
▢
Once the rasgullas have rested for a while, taste the sugar syrup and check for sweetness.
▢
If you prefer more sweeter rasgullas or syrup, then add ¼ cup sugar to a small pot. 
▢
With the help of a ladle transfer about 3/4 cup sugar syrup to the pot and make a sugar syrup. Cool this and pour to the rasgulla pot or pan.
